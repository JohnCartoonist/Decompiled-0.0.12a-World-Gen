# Decompiled-0.0.12a-World-Gen
This is a simple decompilation of the world generator from an early developer version of Minecraft Classic 0.0.12a (which is labeled as 0.011a on the official Minecraft launcher for some reason). You can feel free to use this world generator for whatever you so please, I would honestly love to see somebody porting this thing in the form of a Minecraft mod.
